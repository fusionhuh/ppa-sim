1) Gates - Add gate var when encountered -- track index within object

2) Delays - Add delay var when creating equations Di -- track with index
            for each fanin w/ Dj
	        add Di >= Dj + ...
                for each gate input k
                    add term for Rk Ci delay
                Number of terms in this row (delay Dj + gate delay) = number of fanins

3) Gate size constraints:
        for each gate G
            add lower bound constraint (as row)
            add upper bound constratint (as row)

4) Area constraint:
        for each gate G
            add row (term) for G
